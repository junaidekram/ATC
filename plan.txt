Phase 0 – Scope & Core Realism Requirements

Airport: Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD)

Airspace: Include approach/departure paths for arriving and departing aircraft.

Simulation realism goals:

Realistic number of aircraft on the ground and approaching.

Realistic aircraft types (A350, 737, 320, regional jets, turboprops).

Aircraft follow real-world speed and altitude profiles: taxiing, takeoff, climb, approach, landing.

Aircraft follow actual approach/departure paths.

Ground and air separation enforced dynamically.

Players are in control like a real ATC: clearances, taxi instructions, runway assignment, holding patterns.

Plane counts (initial realistic numbers):

Ground: 20–40 planes at gates and taxiways.

Airspace: 10–20 planes in holding patterns or on approach.

Traffic ramp-up: As the game progresses, more planes appear; player must manage throughput.

Phase 1 – Map & Airspace Design

1. Map Selection & Scale:

Sources:

OpenStreetMap (OSM) for airport diagram, taxiways, runways.

FAA airport diagrams (PDF) for terminal, gates, runway orientation.

Optional: Use satellite imagery for the surrounding area.

Recommended map range around Chicago:

50 miles radius is realistic for approach/departure patterns.

Provides enough space for multiple STARs and SID routes.

Zoom levels:

Max zoom out → 50 miles view for the player to see all planes.

Close zoom → 1–2 mile radius around airport for gate/runway detail.

2. Airspace Layers:

Ground layer: Terminals, gates, taxiways, aprons.

Runway layer: Mark runways with numbers, lengths, and orientation.

Airspace layer:

Arrival corridors (STARs) from all directions.

Departure corridors (SIDs) from each runway.

Holding patterns with assigned altitudes.

Elevation:

Include basic terrain elevation for realism (not crucial for visual collision, but for altitude display).

Source: OpenTopoMap or SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data.

3. Map Size Considerations:

Chicago O’Hare airport footprint ~7 miles across.

Surrounding airspace (50 miles) → covers all realistic approach and departure paths.

Player should be able to zoom out for full control overview, zoom in for taxi/runway management.

Phase 2 – Aircraft & Flight Dynamics

1. Aircraft Data:

Include:

Type, wingspan, length, required runway distance.

Max/min speed, climb/descent rates, taxi speeds.

Gate assignment restrictions (widebody vs narrowbody).

Use JSON or CSV to store aircraft specs.

2. Flight Profiles:

Ground:

Taxi speed varies: 10–30 knots depending on aircraft type and congestion.

Acceleration/deceleration when starting/stopping or turning.

Takeoff:

Acceleration along runway → rotation → climb → reach assigned departure speed/altitude.

Approach/Landing:

Reduce speed gradually on approach.

Follow glide slope for descent (~3° standard).

Touchdown → slow down → exit runway → taxi to gate.

Real-time updates:

Altitude, heading, and speed updated every frame.

When a plane is selected in the side panel or on the map, display its live speed, altitude, next waypoint, and flight status.

3. Dynamic Behavior:

Planes can accelerate/decelerate in response to:

Player instructions (hold, extend taxi route).

Runway congestion.

Approach pattern adjustments.

Phase 3 – Traffic Management

1. Realistic Traffic Levels:

Ground:

Start with realistic number of planes at gates: ~25–40.

Include pushback and taxi sequences.

Air:

Arrival queue: 10–15 planes within 50 miles.

Departure queue: planes waiting for takeoff clearance at gates or taxiways.

2. ATC Control Responsibilities:

Player clears planes for:

Taxi to runway.

Takeoff.

Landing approach.

Holding patterns or runway switches.

Congestion consequences:

Delays if the player doesn’t clear planes efficiently.

Risk of collisions if clearances are mismanaged.

3. Panels & Interaction:

Takeoff queue panel: all planes ready to push back or taxi.

Landing queue panel: all planes approaching the airport.

Clickable plane → detailed info:

Type, speed, altitude, heading, next waypoint, origin/destination.

Buttons for clearance, hold, reroute.

Phase 4 – Zoom & Visualization

Dynamic plane icons:

Zoomed out → simple icons for all planes.

Zoomed in → detailed top-down aircraft with orientation and realistic sprite.

Zoom limits:

Max zoom out → full 50-mile view.

Max zoom in → gate/runway details (2-mile radius).

Elevation visualization:

Show altitude numerically on the plane’s label.

Optional: color-code altitude for quick visualization.

Phase 5 – Pathfinding & Collision Management

1. Ground Paths:

Use A* or Dijkstra to navigate taxiways.

Avoiding blocked paths and planes in front.

2. Runway Use:

Runway occupancy check:

Only one plane on the runway at a time (realistic spacing).

Separation rules for departures/arrivals (~3–5 nautical miles on approach).

3. Airspace Collision Prevention:

Planes maintain minimum vertical and horizontal separation:

1000 ft vertical separation below 10,000 ft.

3000 ft vertical above 10,000 ft.

~3–5 nautical miles horizontal separation.

Holding patterns automatically assigned if conflicts detected.

Phase 6 – AI & Scheduling

Arrivals: spawn planes at edges of 50-mile radius → follow STARs → enter holding pattern if needed.

Departures: schedule departures from gates → taxi → runway → climb to assigned SID.

Peak realism:

Stagger arrivals/departures so player manages throughput.

Include delays for missed clearances, congested taxiways/runways.

Phase 7 – Sources for Maps and Data

Airport diagrams & gates: FAA charts → https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dafd

Runways & taxiways: OpenStreetMap (OSM) → free, accurate coordinates.

Elevation:

SRTM (NASA) → ~30m resolution for surrounding terrain.

OpenTopoMap → more readable.

Airspace data:

FAA Sectional charts → for STARs/SIDs and controlled airspace.

Recommended Airspace Radius: 50 miles

Captures all major approach paths and holding patterns.

Enough space for realistic ATC workload without being overwhelming.

Phase 8 – Performance & Real-Time Simulation

Simulation loop:

Update plane positions, speeds, altitude per frame.

Update AI pathfinding when necessary.

Update panels and UI in real time.

Optimization:

Only render visible planes.

Use simplified icons when zoomed out.

Limit AI calculations to active planes (near airport or selected).
